# SmartPhone-Data-Pipeline-n8n

SmartPhone Data Pipeline is an automated ETL workflow built in n8n that retrieves smartphone information from an external API, filters devices based on storage capacity, processes/normalizes the data, stores it in Google Sheets, generates an XLSX report, and finally emails it to a recipient.
This workflow ensures a clean, structured, automated delivery of smartphone data — ready for analysis or reporting.
